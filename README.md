# Computer VIsion Mid-Semester Project
# Vehicle License Plate Color Classification using Computer Vision

---

## Background

In recent years, the implementation of Computer Vision technology has expanded significantly across transportation systems and traffic management. One of its key applications is in the automatic detection and identification of vehicles through camera systems. While most existing systems focus on license plate character recognition (OCR), an important feature is often overlooked: the color of the license plate.

Indonesia, license plate colors:
- **Black** â†’ Private Vehicle  
- **Yellow** â†’ Public/commercial transport 
- **Red** â†’ Government-owned vehicles  
- **Putih** â†’ Private Vehicle (2022 - Now)  
- **Blue** â†’ Electric Vehicle

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to automatically classify the color of vehicle license plates using computer vision techniques.

---

## Project Benefits

Identifying the color of a license plate can serve as a valuable feature in systems such as traffic surveillance, smart parking, automated toll systems, and electronic law enforcement (ETLE).
